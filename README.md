# TUOS-COM-Reengineering-GroupAssignment-Template

This is a group repository for your group assignment. 

Please see the group assignment document available on the Blackboard.

## Initial setup
The first thing you should do is choose and download one of the three open-source legacy software systems you want to reengineer:
- commons-csv (https://github.com/donghwan-shin/commons-csv)
- commons-compress (https://github.com/donghwan-shin/commons-compress)
- commons-numbers (https://github.com/donghwan-shin/commons-numbers)

Then, you should push the code downloaded from the above link as the first commit of this repository. 
To do this, please do the following:
1. Clone this repository to a folder X in your local machine. In the folder X, you should see this readme file.
2. Move all the files of "commons-x" into the folder X. You must overwrite this readme file.
3. Use the following commands to commit all the files and push the commit to the origin of this repository:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
git push
```

Once the code is up on your group repository, itâ€™s ready to start.
